ketosense for Raspberry Pi
==========================

A ketosis detector based on work by JensLabs.

This is the source-code for a Raspberry Pi 2 controlled breath acetone detector. The purpouse for the instrument is to detect
if a person is in a metabilic state called ketosis. The instrument uses an electrochemical gas sensor called TGS822.
A digital temperatur and humidity sensor called DHT11. A 2x16 char LCD display and is powered by a Raspberry Pi 2 board.

This project is a modification of the Arduino ketosense developed by JensLabs. A more detailed description can be found at http://jenslabs.com/category/electronics/ketosis-detector/
